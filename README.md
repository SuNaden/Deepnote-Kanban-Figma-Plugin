## Deepnote Kanban

Deepnote tracks the status of designs by moving them into a page section in Figma. It's not fun dragging a page across 50 other pages and there are no shortcuts to help us with this afaik ðŸ˜¢

This is a simple plugin to move the currently selected page to the right place (or to create a new page in playgrounds if you are cooking with something new).

**Example**
